	Not included in this book is the important but somewhat more sophisticated
topic of spectral sequences. It was very tempting to include something about this
marvelous tool here, but spectral sequences are such a big topic that it seemed best
to start with themafresh in a new volume. This is tentatively titled ‘Spectral Sequences
in Algebraic Topology’ and is referred to herein as [SSAT]. There is also a third book in
progress, on vector bundles, characteristic classes, and K–theory, which will be largely
independent of [SSAT] and also of much of the present book. This is referred to as
[VBKT], its provisional title being ‘Vector Bundles and K–Theory.’
In terms of prerequisites, the present book assumes the reader has some familiarity
with the content of the standard undergraduate courses in algebra and point-set
topology. In particular, the reader should know about quotient spaces, or identification
spaces as they are sometimes called, which are quite important for algebraic
topology. Good sources for this concept are the textbooks [Armstrong 1983] and
[J¨anich 1984] listed in the Bibliography.
A book such as this one, whose aim is to present classical material from a rather
classical viewpoint, is not the place to indulge in wild innovation. There is, however,
one small novelty in the exposition that may be worth commenting upon, even though
in the book as a whole it plays a relatively minor role. This is the use of what we call
Δ complexes, which are a mild generalization of the classical notion of a simplicial
complex. The idea is to decompose a space into simplices allowing different faces of
a simplex to coincide and dropping the requirement that simplices are uniquely determined
by their vertices. For example, if one takes the standard picture of the torus
as a square with opposite edges identified and divides the square into two triangles
by cutting along a diagonal, then the result is a Δ complex structure on the torus
having 2 triangles, 3 edges, and 1 vertex. By contrast, a simplicial complex structure
on the torus must have at least 14 triangles, 21 edges, and 7 vertices. So Δ complexes
provide a significant improvement in efficiency, which is nice froma pedagogical viewpoint
since it cuts down on tedious calculations in examples. A more fundamental
reason for considering Δ complexes is that they seem to be very natural objects from
the viewpoint of algebraic topology. They are the natural domain of definition for
simplicial homology, and a number of standard constructions produce Δ complexes
rather than simplicial complexes, for instance the singular complex of a space, or the
classifying space of a discrete group or category. Historically, Δ complexes were first
introduced by Eilenberg and Zilber in 1950 under the name of semisimplicial complexes.
This term later came to mean something different
